| Editing / Creation | For all applications involved in creating or modifying content of any kind (images, documents, audio, video, code, video games, etc.). |
| Content / Consumption | For applications that allow users to experience content (media players, RSS readers, e-book readers, etc.). |
| Games / Interactive | For native games and games running with compatibility layers (excluding emulation), and other interactive experiences. Simulations may also fall into this category. |
| Emulation | For applications that emulate other systems to run software designed for those systems (retro gaming emulators, DOSBox, virtual MIDI devices, etc.). |
| File Management / Sharing | For applications that organize, manipulate, and transfer files (file managers, archive managers, file transfer clients, etc.). |
| Virtualization / Containers | For applications that create isolated environments to run software (VirtualBox, Docker, etc. - distinct from emulation). |
| Connections / Communication | For applications that allow users to communicate with others, browse the internet, and do other transient networking tasks. |
| Assistance / Automation | Applications that help the user interact with the system more effectively. This includes tools that provide accessibility, AI assistance, or automate tasks. The primary focus is on facilitating user control over the system, regardless of the underlying technology. |
| Hardware / Devices | For applications that configure or manage how hardware devices connect and communicate with the system. (gamepads, phone syncing, pen tablets, RGB settings, XR headsets, etc.) This focuses on user-level settings, not system-wide changes. |
| Tools | For tools that do not permanently make changes, such as calculators. |
| User Utilities | For tools that only concerned with the current user or their experience. (User calendars, desktop appearance, etc..) |
| System Configuration | For tools that affect multiple users, or the entire system. (firewalls, parental controls, etc..) |
